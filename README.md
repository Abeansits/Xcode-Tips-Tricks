VICTORIOUS TECH TALK - Productivity hacks for Xcode

Xcode it not Eclipse but it still has a ton of features, much of these are hidden away. Which is a good thing but we are power users and therefore we could gain a lot by exploring! I remember when Xcode and IB was two different tools and this is a list of some of the most useful tricks I have gathered over the years. 

Key commands:
* Switch tabs: ⌘ + ⇧ + [
* Comment out selection: ⌘ + /
* Move line up/down, respects indentation: ⌘ + ⎇ + [ ]
* Indent left/right: ⌘ + [ ]
* Format selection: ⌃ + I
* Follow: ⎇ + click
* Follow in new window: ⌘ + double click
* Open in assistans editor: ⌘ + ⎇ + click
* Inline documentation: ⎇ + Click
* Select column: ⎇ + select
* Reveal in project navigator: ⌘ + ⇧ + J
* Clean console: ⌘ + K
* Edit in scope: ⌃ + ⌘ + E
* Show Navigator: ⌘ + 1…8
* Hide Navigator: ⌘ + 0
* Show/Hide Utilities: ⌘ + ⎇ + 0
* Dropdowns: ⌃ + 1…6
    * Recursive filters
* Enable/Disable breakpoints: ⌘ + y
* Add/Remove breakpoint at current line: ⌘ + \
* Move focus in editor: ⌘ + J
* Run: ⌘ + R
* Build: ⌘ + B

* Clean: ⌘ + ⇧ + K
* Fold scope: ⌘ + ⎇ + <-
* Unfold scope: ⌘ + ⎇ + ->
* Fold all: ⌘ + ⎇ + ⇧ + <-

Behaviors:
* Build fails: Navigate to first issue
* Running completes: Hide navigator/utilities
* Custom behavior: Connect to key command 
* Speak announcements =)

Exceptions:
* No need to build & run loop.
* Configure with conditions.

Debug view hierarchy:
* Click the small icon on the debug-toolbar.
* Great for debugging auto-layout constraints.
* Reveal is a lot more powerful! You can edit live data.

Alcatraz:
* Package manager for Xcode: ⌘ + ⇧ + 9
* Disclaimer: New Xcode version will probably break.

Code snippets:
* Add your own.
* Download from github: https://github.com/burczyk/XcodeSwiftSnippets

4-square-menu:
* Only Obj-C for now.
* Extremely useful!

Misc:
* Line numbers n settings.
* Code folding!
* Show TODOs and FIXMEs and warnings
